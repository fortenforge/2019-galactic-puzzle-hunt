    <p>My uncle is notorious for his get rich quick schemes. He was messaging me constantly during his last one. I

    <h3>Notes on Business</h3>

    <p>The Galactic Exchange only allows for four types of goods to be bought and sold: <span class="novelty">Novelty</span>,
        <span class="rare-earth">Rare Earth</span>, <span class="gene">Gene</span>, and <span class="alien">Alien</span>.</p>

    <p>Looking at the <a target="_blank" href="../static/puzzle_resources/galactic-race/GalacticDirectory.csv">Galactic Directory</a> I have, I’ve figured out where I can pick up goods, and where I can sell different types of goods.</p>

    <h4> Possible Pick Up Locations</h4>
    <p class="business-subheading"> Regulations and taxes mean I won’t be able to leave any of these places having picked up more than one good.</p>

    <ul>
        <li class="novelty">Alien Burial Site</li>
        <li class="alien">Alien Data Repository</li>
        <li class="alien">Alien Guardian</li>
        <li class="alien">Alien Monolith</li>
        <li class="alien">Alien Robotic Factory</li>

        <li class="novelty">Galactic Resort</li>

    <h4>Possible Sell Locations</h4>
    <p class="business-subheading">The way the market is right now, I can probably sell the shown maximum at the

<p class="message">Sorry I'm leaving while you’re stuck working at the Terraforming Guild. I know you're only a day
    away, but I can't stick around.</p>

<div class="date">12/5/20XX</div>

<p class="message">And you said this Alien Robotic Factory wouldn't work out! The robotics production line is up and
    running!</p>

<div class="date">12/6/20XX</div>

<p class="message">Met up with a friend. He's a Contact Specialist. Says he has some work for me.</p>

<div class="date">12/7/20XX</div>

<p class="message">Friend and I are getting drinks at the Rebel Cantina. He says he can get me in to see some of the
    rebels.</p>

<div class="date">12/8/20XX</div>

<p class="message">These guys are negotiating a Rebel Pact. Want us to come back in a day or two. Won't be home for a
    while!</p>

<div class="date">12/9/20XX</div>

<p class="message">Visited the Artist Colony while we're waiting for the Rebels to finish.</p>

        a cool painting!</p> <div class="date">12/10/20XX</div>

    <p class="message">Accidentally went to visit the Reptilian Uplift Race. Didn't mean to, but I guess I can pick up
        some
        stuff while I'm here.</p>

    <p class="message">Remind me not to continue to Old Earth. No one goes there anymore.</p>

    <div class="date">12/15/20XX</div>

    <p class="message">Sorry for the radio silence! I took a nearly complete tour around the Alien Booby Trap.</p>

    <p class="message">I totally forgot about the rebels! I need to get back there. I'm gonna take the shortest path I
        can
        to get back that doesn't take me through that trap.</p>

    <p class="message">BUT NOT THROUGH NEW SPARTA. I'm not that reckless!</p>

    <div class="date">12/20/20XX</div>

    <p class="message">Geez, they only just finished negotiations of this Rebel Pact!</p>

    <p class="message">I gotta admit, it's really cheeky of them to do these negotiations next to the New Galactic
        Order.</p>

    <p class="message">I mean, New Sparta isn't setting that up for nothing, you know?</p>

    <div class="date">12/21/20XX</div>

    <p class="message">Looks we're celebrating this new Rebel Alliance now.</p>

    <p class="message">The foreman tells me it's for the neighboring Robotic Factory. I'm really excited about that!</p>

    <div class="date">12/23/20XX</div>

    <p class="message">Found the edge of the galaxy!</p>

    <p class="message">Turning left, because the Secluded World is to the right, and they are very much not friendly.</p>

    <div class="date">12/24/20XX</div>

    <p class="message">Ah. New Earth. Much better than the Old Earth.</p>

    <p class="message">Was going to go to the Consumer Markets right next to here, but a friend just called me about a
        new
        investment opportunity. I'll be visiting him first.</p>

    <div class="date">12/26/20XX</div>

    <p class="message">Visiting that friend I mentioned. He's been working with his Alien Research Team.</p>

    <div class="date">12/28/20XX</div>

    <p class="message">Ew. Don't know why I'm here at the Plague World. Remind me to sanitize my ship later</p>

    <p class="message">Saw some Drop Ships when I came from galactic north.</p>

    <p class="message">I think I saw a Colony Ship even farther g-north?</p>

    <p class="message">Probably came from the planet even further in that direction. What was it again? The Spice
        World?</p>

    <div class="date">12/29/20XX</div>

    <p class="message">THE SHIP IS CLEAN!!!!!!!!! Facilities at the Consumer Markets are expensive, but this was
        totally
        worth it.</p>

    <div class="date">12/30/20XX</div>

    <p class="message">At the Mining League. Couldn't sell all of my junk yesterday, but these guys were interested in
        some
        more stuff I had.</p>

    <div class="date">12/31/20XX</div>

    <p class="message">I'm glad I'm in the robotics business. These Replicant Robots are pretty sweet! </p>

    <p class="message">You know, the only other kind of robots I've seen have been Mining Robots. And they seem to be
        only
        on the same galactic row as home.</p>

    <div class="date">1/1/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">WHY DO I HAVE TO PAY EXPORT DUTIES? I'm working with these people for galaxy's sake!</p>

    <div class="date">1/2/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Visiting one of the rebel factions at the Rebel Homeworld. There's apparently a trading outpost
        near
        here. I'm gonna go see if they're interested in buying.</p>

    <div class="date">1/3/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">WHAT ARE IMPERIUM TROOPS DOING HERE?!?!</p>

    <div class="date">1/5/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">People at this Trading Outpost aren't buying. Disappointed.</p>

    <div class="date">1/7/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">AND NOW THERE'S AN IMPERIUM INVASION FLEET! I'M LEAVING THIS SECTOR AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.</p>

    <div class="date">1/8/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Made it back to the Rebel Homeworld safely.</p>

    <p class="message"><img value="#imperium-troops-map" class="attatchment" src="../static/puzzle_resources/galactic-race/paperclip.png">So between what the Rebels here already knew about this sector and my discoveries, we cobbled together
        this
        map.</p>

    <p class="message">They just told me about a Hidden Fortress they know of. The instructions they gave me were very
        specific: travel one day g-north, then turn right, left, left again, then right, and you'll find the fortress.</p>

    <div class="date">1/11/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Just passed a Colony Ship. Dunno what they're doing all the way out here.</p>

    <div class="date">1/13/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">According to the directions the Rebels gave me, the Hidden Fortress should be right here. I
        don't
        see it though. I'm gonna keep looking.</p>

    <div class="date">1/15/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Oh man, I found the Hidden Fortress! I flew right by it the first time!</p>

    <p class="message">Accidentally found the Hive World yesterday instead of finding the fortress. Barely got back here alive.
        Gonna
        sit here overnight till I stop shaking.</p>

    <div class="date">1/16/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Oh man, you remember me talking about this Alien Monolith? Well, it's even more beautiful in
        person.</p>

    <div class="date">1/17/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Hey! Met up with a friend here at Galactic Engineering for lunch.</p>

    <p class="message">He's still excited about all those minerals they're getting from the neighboring Volcanic World.</p>

    <div class="date">1/18/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">WHAT IS WITH THESE EXPORT DUTIES?!</p>

    <div class="date">1/21/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Not sure why, but I ended up spending the night at this Rebel Outpost. These guys seem really
        disorganized.</p>

    <div class="date">1/22/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Hey, remember yesterday when I said they seemed disorganized? THEY JUST AMBUSHED ME! We're all
        sorted out now, but this is just ridiculous. What, are they trying to practice Rebel Sneak Attack tactics on
        me?</p>

    <div class="date">1/23/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Hey, didn't you want something from Lifeforms Inc.? I'm actually at the Genetics Lab right now,
        not
        the offices. Just trying to remember.</p>

    <div class="date">1/24/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">This Expedition Force my friend from the ART sent me to talk to is quite alright. Definitely
        know
        what they're doing. We're gonna survey these places. Talk to you in a few days!</p>

    <div class="date">1/27/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Really enjoying what I've seen here, especially this Deserted Alien Colony.</p>

    <p class="message">Yup. This is gonna pay off really nicely. Surveyed everything on the map. </p>

    <div class="date">1/31/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Finally made it to the Pilgrimage World. Not that I'm religious or anything, but I feel it's a
        place
        everyone should visit at least once, you know?</p>

    <div class="date">2/2/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Hmmm. Should I tell these Imperium Troops I'm working with the Rebels? How about "I'm not that
        into
        getting arrested?"</p>

    <p class="message">Looks like there's some Drop Ships up ahead. I'm gonna do what I can to avoid them.</p>

    <div class="date">2/4/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">They're building this ridiculous thing... I think they're calling it an Imperium Planet Buster?</p>

    <div class="date">2/7/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">You know, I think seeing the Galactic Imperium is enough. I don't need to visit the throne.</p>

    <div class="date">2/9/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Did you know these guys are developing Imperium Cloaking Technology? Well, you do now.</p>

    <div class="date">2/10/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">If anyone asks, no, I didn't steal any plans to the Imperium Planet Buster.</p>

    <div class="date">2/11/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Got out of Imperium space with some valuable intelligence thanks to some Rebel Freedom Fighters.</p>

    <p class="message"><img value="#merchant-district" class="attatchment" src="../static/puzzle_resources/galactic-race/paperclip.png">I think I'm gonna take a break, get some stuff in the merchant district, and then meet up again with
        the
        Rebels. </p>

    <div class="date">2/13/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Whoa... ever consider getting a job with the Alien Tech Institute?</p>

    <p class="message"><img value="#institute" class="attatchment" src="../static/puzzle_resources/galactic-race/paperclip.png">Oh, now this is cool! </p>

    <div class="date">2/14/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Huh. This Avian Uplift Race is really friendly.</p>

    <p class="message">They also provide an Uplift Mercenary Force for the district. I think they're training nearby.</p>

    <div class="date">2/15/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">There's so much cool information in this Deserted Alien Library!</p>

    <p class="message">Galactic Survey: SETI is set up near here. I should probably get a friend on that team. What do
        you
        think?</p>

    <div class="date">2/16/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">I'd love to stay and relax at this Galactic Resort, but there's just too much stuff to do!</p>

    <p class="message">You know, it may just be a branch of the Interstellar Bank, but it's one of the most beautiful
        things you can see from here. And that's saying something!</p>

    <p class="message"><img value="#postcard" class="attatchment" src="../static/puzzle_resources/galactic-race/paperclip.png">Oh yeah. Forgot I picked this up a while ago. Have a postcard. </p>

    <div class="date">2/21/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Meeting with the some people in the Rebel Underground.</p>

    <p class="message"><img value="#imperium-space" class="attatchment" src="../static/puzzle_resources/galactic-race/paperclip.png">I gave them the intelligence I acquired on Imperium space. </p>

    <div class="date">2/22/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">We're moving to make that attack. Just gotta avoid these Space Marines first.</p>

    <div class="date">2/25/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Yeah, I'm not sticking around for the Rebel Sneak Attack to start. Hope I can get home soon.</p>

    <div class="date">2/26/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">WOULD YOU TELL THIS IMPERIUM WARLORD TO STOP CHASING ME?!</p>

    <p class="message">NO MORE TIME TO TALK. I'M MAKING A STRAIGHT SHOT TO THE BLACK HOLES.</p>

    <p class="message">Hopefully these Black Hole MIners don't mind that I'm dodging through their territory…</p>

    <p class="message">Whew. I lost the warlord. This old ship handles those black holes really well.</p>

    <div class="date">3/3/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Met up with another Expedition Force.</p>

    <p class="message"><img value="#expedition-force" class="attatchment" src="../static/puzzle_resources/galactic-race/paperclip.png">This one was looking to explore past this corner of the galaxy. You know, into this whole lot of nothing?
    </p>

    <div class="date">3/5/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Finally met up with the Contact Specialist again. Not in the same place, of course. He's gotta
        cover
        his tracks!</p>

    <p class="message">He says he can get me into the Galactic Exchange that's a day out from here. I'm gonna take him
        up
        on that, considering that's what I wanted to do in the first place!</p>

    <p class="message">Oh yeah, now that the Imperium is sorta kinda after me, my contact needs to do some extra work
        to
        get me into the GE safely. It's only two days travel from the Seat and the Warlord, after all.</p>

    <div class="date">3/7/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Alright. Gonna have to sneak past these Space Marines that are (probably) still looking for me
        to
        get home.</p>

    <div class="date">3/8/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">So that Imperium Cloaking Tech? Works great. Didn't see them approach. Running now!</p>

    <div class="date">3/9/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Sorry! Can't visit you while I'm here at the Terraforming Guild! Gotta keep moving!</p>

    <p class="message">Can't fly home, either. Gotta lose them first!</p>

    <div class="date">3/12/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Ha! Maybe these Black Hole Miners can salvage some of those poor ships!</p>

    <p class="message">This ship handles these black holes even better than the old one did!</p>

    <div class="date">3/13/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Making a deposit of all my hard-earned money from this trip at the Interstellar Bank!</p>

    <p class="message">Won't be gambling this away. Can't show my face at the Gambling World anyway, with it being
        right
        next to the Seat and all.</p>

    <div class="date">3/14/20XY</div>

    <p class="message">Ah. Home sweet Galactic Trendsetters. Want to go out for drinks later?</p>

    <p class="message">Oh, don't be surprised by the new ship. Got it from the Separatist Colony only time I was there.
        Haven't had time to repaint it yet.</p>

    <p class="message">What an adventure! Only revisited a place nine times (home doesn’t count), and never visited the
        same
        spot more than twice!</p>

    <p class="message">Well, now I can say I've been nearly everywhere in the galaxy!</p>
